## Ingredients

* 2 10oz packages frozen chopped broccoli
* 6 cups shredded cooked chicken breast
* 2 tsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 (8 oz) package sliced mushrooms
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* ½ tsp dried thyme
* 1 (10 3/4 oz) can cream of mushroom soup
* 1 cup chicken broth
* ½ cup light mayonnaise
* ½ cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt
* 2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 tsp curry powder
* 1 Tbsp butter, melted

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray a 2-quart casserole or 13 x 9-inch baking dish with nonstick spray.
2. Remove the outer wrappers from the boxes of broccoli. Open one end of each box. Microwave on full power
for 2 minutes, until thawed. Drain and put into the prepared baking dish. Top with the chicken.
3. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until they release their juices and thoroughly brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme during the last minute of cooking time. Add to the baking dish with the chicken and broccoli.
4. In a medium bowl, whisk together the soup, broth, mayonnaise, yogurt, 2/3 cup of the Parmesan cheese, the curry powder, and pepper. Pour over the broccoli-chicken mixture and mix well with a spatula.
5. Grate the bread over the large holes of a box grater to make coarse soft crumbs. Combine the bread crumbs, melted butter, and the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese in a small bowl until blended; sprinkle evenly over the top of the casserole.
6. Bake, uncovered, until the filling is bubbly around the edges and the topping is lightly browned, 30-40 minutes.
