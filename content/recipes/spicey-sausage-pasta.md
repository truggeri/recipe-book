## Ingredients

* 1 pound smoked sausage
* 1½ cup diced onion
* 2 cloves garlic
* 2 cups (8 ounce) chicken broth
* 1 (10oz) can Ro-Tel tomatoes with green chilies
* ½ cup heavy cream
* 8 oz penne pasta
* ½ tsp salt and pepper
* 1 cup Montery Jack (or cheddar) cheese, shredded
* ⅓ cup thinly sliced scallions

## Steps

1. Add olive oil to a skillet over medium high heat until just smoking.
2. Add sausage and onions and cook until lightly browned, about 4 minutes.
3. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
4. Add broth, tomatoes, cream, pasta, salt and pepper and stir. Bring to a boil, cover skillet, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until pasta is tender, about 15 minutes.
5. Remove skillet from heat and stir in ½ cup cheese.
6. Top with remaining cheese and sprinkle with scallions. Broil until cheese is melted, spotty brown, and bubbly.
