## Ingredients

* ¼ oz. Cilantro
* ½ oz. Grated Cotija Cheese
* 2 oz. Guacamole
* 1 Poblano Pepper
* 1 Red Onion
* 1 Roma Tomato
* 8 oz. Shrimp
* 6 Small Flour Tortillas
* Sour Cream
* 1 oz. Tomato Chipotle Butter

## Steps

### 1. Prepare Ingredients

Halve and peel onion. Slice halves into thin strips. Core tomato and cut into ¼" dice. Mince cilantro (no need to stem). Stem poblano pepper, seed, and cut into ½" dice. Poblano peppers can vary in spice level; most are mild, but a few can be quite hot. Wash hands and cutting board after prepping. Combine tomato, guacamole, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a mixing bowl. Set aside. Pat shrimp dry, and season all over with ¼ tsp. salt and a pinch of pepper.

### 2. Start the filling

Place a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat and add 2 tsp. olive oil. Add onion to hot pan and stir occasionally until beginning to soften, 1-2 minutes. Add poblano and stir occasionally until lightly charred and tender, 3-5 minutes.

### 3. Finish the filling

Working in batches if necessary, add shrimp and a pinch of pepper to pan. Stir occasionally until shrimp reaches a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees, 3-5 minutes. Remove from burner. Add chipotle tomato butter and stir to combine.

### 4. Warm the tortillas

Wrap tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave until warm, 30-60 seconds.

### 5. Finish the dish

Plate dish as pictured on front of card, filling tortillas with filling. Garnish with guacamole, sour cream, cilantro, and cheese (crumbling with hands if necessary).
